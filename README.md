# Photo-Gallery-App
This is an app developed for learning purposes.
In this app I used RxJava, Glide, and MVP pattern to create a more readable app. There may be some mistakes on the implementation but they 
will be fixed while keeping the development of the app.

# Features
Actually the app, list albums, show what is inside the albums and show a picture with a grid below the main frame.

# Future Feature
- Delete a picture.
- Share a picture.
- Take a picture inside the app.

# Notes
